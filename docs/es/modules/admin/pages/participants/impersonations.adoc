= Participants Impersonations

For participants that don't have the knowledge or don't have an email for registering
an account, there's the Impersonation feature.

This allows an 'Administrator' or 'Participant manager' to search through a
Verification system for an already existing participant and also to create a
participant without email.

NOTE: At the code and the User Interface we say both *Impersonation* and *Managed
Participants*. It's the same thing.

== Panel

This is the panel where you can find all the participants:

* by filtering by managed or not managed participants
* by searching by name

After you've clicked in `Manage new participant` you'll go to the form to enter
the personal data to check against the verification:

NOTE: If you don't see the `Manage new participant` button, is because this feature
only works when you have a Verification of kind `direct` (also known
as `form authorizations`). See in your xref:admin:system.adoc[system panel] which
`Available authorizations` are enabled. You can learn more regarding how to program
your form authorization in https://github.com/decidim/decidim/blob/develop/decidim-verifications/README.md[decidim-verification README].

After this data is confirmed then there'll be a session for the participant for
30 minutes:

Finally, it's also possible to Promote a participant, meaning that after a
participant has been managed, an administrator can add the email and send her
an Invitation:
