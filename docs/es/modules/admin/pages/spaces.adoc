= Spaces

The participatory spaces are the channels that citizens can participate through when public decisions are being taken. By default
the platform is provided with participatory processes, initiatives, consultations, conferences, votings and assemblies, but
any organization can develop its own mechanisms through xref:develop:modules.adoc[Modules].

They are accessible through the main sidebar in the administration panel, and also through the main navigation menu in the
public interface.
