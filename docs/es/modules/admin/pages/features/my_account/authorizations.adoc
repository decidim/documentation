= Authorizations

In this section participants will be able to review their Authorizations and see some metadata, like when it was granted
or the status of the authorization.

It depends on how it's configured for the organization, as depending in the context (like normative or laws) it could work
in different ways. For more information about Authorizations see xref:admin:participants/authorizations.adoc[authorizations
in admin manual] and xref:customize:authorizations.adoc[authorizations in customize guide].
