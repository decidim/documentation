= Categories

Categories (and subcategories) are used for classifying resources inside of a space.

An administrator can define them, can be assigned to when creating resources, and then participants can filter the
different resources by these categories. For instance, they can be set up in proposals, meetings and debates.

As an example of this mechanism in action you can see it in https://meta.decidim.org/processes/roadmap/f/122/[Propose new functionalities for Decidim software] process:

. Administrators have defined the categories in the process.
. Participants can create proposals that have one category.
. Participants can filter by these categories and navigate among all the proposals.

NOTE: Once a category is in use it cannot be removed, as there are resources that are using it.

Decidim has other ways to classify resources, for instance xref:admin:scopes.adoc[Scopes] and Hashtags.
The main difference is that Categories can be defined in a given space, Scopes are global for all the platform, and Hashtags
are defined by the participants.

Categories can be nested, meaning that a category can have subcategories.
