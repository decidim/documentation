= Space Admins

You can give permissions to users with special rights in a space,
so they can only have access to some of the administration pages in this space.
These roles are administrators, moderators, collaborators, or valuators.

* Administrators: they can administer the space and change the space settings.
* Collaborators: they can see the space and its components before it's published and view the space settings.
They can't change anything.
* Moderators: they can see the reported contents of the space and hide or unhide them.
* Valuators: they can evaluate proposals. Used by participatory budgeting processes.

To invite them, in the space's submenu, go to *Space admins*Â and click on *New space admin*. This depends in the kind of space
that you're, for instance for participatory processes it'd be *Process admins* and *New process admin*.
