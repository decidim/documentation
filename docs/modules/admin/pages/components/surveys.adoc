= Survey

The Survey component allows people to answer questionnaires. This is useful when an organization wants to receive private
feedback, although it's possible to publish the answers manually as well. It allows defining a set of questions with multiple kinds of answers.

From this starting point, there could be other configurations, such as:

* if the answering is limited to a time period
* what answer types should have the questions, like short (one line), long (multiple lines), single or multiple options,
sorting through a list, etc.
* if there's an answer validation like how many characters as maximum should have an answer
* if there's a maximum number of options to select in multiple options questions

Some examples of where this component was used:

* https://consultation.quebec.ca/processes/donneesquebec/f/82/[Data Quebec: participate in its improvement! (Données Québec : participez à son amélioration!) in Québec consultations]
* https://meta.decidim.org/conferences/decidimfest2020/f/1403/?locale=en[DecidimFest2020 Assessment Survey]

To configure the Survey component:

. Sign in as admin
. Go to admin panel
. In the main sidebar, click in the button for the space that you want to configure the component for.
For instance, it could be "Processes", "Assemblies" or "Conferences".
. Go to components
. Click on "Add component" button
. Click on "Survey"
. Fill the xref:_add_component[Add component] form

Once a survey is already answered by some users it's not possible to modify its questions, as that would affect the integrity
of the answers. If it's needed to modify the questions, then it's needed to create a new survey and unpublish the original one.

== Templates

For the cases where administrators need to define multiple surveys that are mostly the same but used in different contexts,
it's possible to define a template. When there's one defined for a survey, then it'll ask to select the Template and create
the survey based on this one or in the other hand if there's no need to use a template, then it's possible to Skip the template
selection.

image:components/surveys/edit_questionnaire.png[Choose template form]

== Export answers

It's possible to export the survey participant answers to different formats: CSV, JSON, XLSX (Excel) or PDF.

Note that the platform doesn't handle the answers processing nor presenting results or summary to the users, that need to be
done externally.
