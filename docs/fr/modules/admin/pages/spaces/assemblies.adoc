= Assemblies

An assembly is a group of members of an organization who meet periodically to make decisions about a specific area or
scope of the organization.

Assemblies hold meetings, some are private and some are open. If they are open, it is possible to participate in them
(for example: attending if the capacity allows it, adding points to the agenda, or commenting on the proposals and decisions taken by this organ).

Examples: A general assembly (which meets once a year to define the organisation's main lines of action as well as its
executive bodies by vote), an equality advisory council (which meets every two months to make proposals on how to improve
gender relations in the organisation), an evaluation commission (which meets every month to monitor a process) or a guarantee
body (which collects incidents, abuses or proposals to improve decision-making procedures) are all examples of assemblies.

The main difference between xref:admin:spaces/processes.adoc[participatory processes] and assemblies is that assemblies don't
have phases, meaning that they don't have timelines.

You can see a real world usage of assemblies in https://www.decidim.barcelona/assemblies[Decidim Barcelona], where you
can see the different Participation Organs, that are the regular spaces where the City Council meets with citizens and organizations
to get feedback.

In this section, we'll explain how we can configure an Assembly in Decidim.

== List

To configure assemblies on the Decidim platform, click on btn:[Assemblies] in the admin sidebar menu. A list
will appear with the existing assemblies if there are any:

image:assemblies_list.png[Assemblies list]

You can filter by the ones that are:

* Published / Unpublished
* Public / Private

image:assemblies_list_filter.png[Assemblies list filtered]

You can also search by title and control how many elements are in the list.

You have 4 possible actions in this list after an Assembly is created:

. Export: send by email the configuration for a given assembly. Can be imported in other Decidim installation.
. Duplicate: to duplicate this assembly.
. Configure: to edit the metadata and configuration for a assembly.
. Assemblies: to manage all the children assemblies for a assembly.
. Preview: how it will look once published.
