= Polls

CAUTION: this feature is still in active development and can't be used in production yet.

Through the manage polls feature is possible to define a poll that will be displayed when an online meeting is ocurring.
This is useful to see quick feedback and make a decision inside the meeting without having to leave the meeting and use
other kind of tools (like surveys or proposals).

With this feature an administrator can define questions and also manage when these questions and its results will be shown
to participants.

== Enable polls for a meeting

To enable polls for a meeting:

. Sign in as admin
. Go to admin panel
. Dans la barre latérale principale, cliquez sur le bouton de l'espace dont vous voulez configurer la fonctionnalité.
For instance, it could be "Processes", "Assemblies", or "Conferences"
. Click on "Meetings"
. Search the meeting that you want to define polls for
. Click on the "Manage polls" button image:action_list.png[Manage polls button]
. Remplissez le formulaire

The form is pretty much the Decidim form builder, with one caveat: you can only define Single and Multiple option questions.
