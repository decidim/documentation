= Collaborative draft

With the collaborative draft feature participants can make a proposal with multiple authors.

It's useful to propose improvements or corrections.

It has similarities with xref:components/proposals/amendments.adoc[Amendments] but the main difference is that with collaborative
drafts there is a need to trust other authors, as they can make any change to the original proposal without approval by the
original author, although the original author can decide if they promote the collaborative draft as a proposal.

reject collaboration requests

. Bob clicks in the "Request access" button

. Alice receives the notification
image:components/proposals/collaborative_drafts/notification.png[]
. Alice goes to the collaborative draft. There they can accept or reject the collaboration request
image:components/proposals/collaborative_drafts/author_sidebar.png[]
. Alice approves the collaboration request. Once a request is approved it can't be rejected
. Now the collaborative draft has multiple authors
image:components/proposals/collaborative_drafts/multiple_authors.png[]
. Bob can edit the collaborative draft by clicking in the "Edit collaborative draft" button

. Once the collabrative draft is edited, then it's possible to see the old versions and its changes

. Once Alice is satisfied with the collaborative draft, they can publish it by click in the "Publish" button
image:components/proposals/collaborative_drafts/publish_modal.png[]
. When it's published it becomes a proposal

. And the collaborative draft is still visible although it can't be edited anymore
