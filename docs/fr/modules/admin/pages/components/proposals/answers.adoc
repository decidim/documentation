== Publication

You can control when the answers will be published by using the "Publish proposal answers immediately" checkbox.

For enabling automatic publication, you'll need to check it.

On the other hand, if you want to control when to publish the answer a proposal or multiple proposals, you'll need to follow these steps:

. Sign in as admin or valuator
. Go to admin panel
. Dans la barre latérale principale, cliquez sur le bouton de l'espace dont vous voulez configurer la fonctionnalité.
For instance, it could be "Processes", "Assemblies", or "Conferences"
. Click in the "Proposals" component
. Search the proposal you want to answer
. Click in the left checkbox of the proposal that you want to publish
. Click on the "Actions" button
. Click on the "Publish answers" option
image:components/proposals/proposal_answer_publish.png[Proposal answer publication: action]
. Click on "Publish" button
image:components/proposals/proposal_answer_publish_button.png[Proposal answer publication: publish button]

NOTE: If you have unchecked the "Publish proposal answers immediately", answered the proposals and then checked the option again, the answers will not be
published automatically. You'll still need to publish the answers manually with the "Actions" button.
