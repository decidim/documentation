= Propositions

The Proposals component allows people to create, comment, endorse, and give support to proposals.

From this starting point, there could be other configurations, such as:

* combien de propositions un participant peut créer
* le nombre maximum de votes qu'un participant peut attribuer aux propositions
* how many supports as a minimum a participant must give to proposals so their supports are valid
* whether you want to enable that participants comment on proposals
* whether you want that proposals have images, attachments, WYSIWYG editor, geolocated address, scopes, etc.

Some examples of where this component was used:

* https://futureu.europa.eu/[Conference of the Future of Europe]
* https://meta.decidim.org/processes/roadmap/f/122/[Propose new functionalities for Decidim software] in https://meta.decidim.org/[Metadecidim]

Proposals can be created by participants if the setting is "Proposal creation enabled" is checked for the active phase.

This form depends a lot in which settings you've enabled in this component. It can be really short (with only a Title and

allows participants to save proposals drafts (unpublished) in case they need to fill too many fields.
