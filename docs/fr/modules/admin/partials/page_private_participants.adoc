= Private participants

There are cases where you want to have a closed census of the participants in a space. For instance this could be a space
for a small group of people, or the members of a comission inside of a big organization. For these cases you can
use the private participants feature.

This form allows you to bulk import the participants of a space.

It must have two columns with email in the first column of the file and the name in the last column of the file (email, name)
of the users that you want to add to the participatory space. Some tips:

* The file should not have headers. That means that you do not have to add a column that says "email, name"
* You must avoid using invalid chars like `<>?%&^*#@()[]=+:;"{}\|` in user name.
* The separator between columns must be a comma (",")

== Actions

After the participants has been invited, you can resend or delete the invitation.
