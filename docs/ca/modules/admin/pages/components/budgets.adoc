= Budgets

:page-toclevels: 4

The Budgets component allows people to vote by selecting projects of their choosing. Depending on the needs and normative
of the organization, this could be configured so people have assigned a total budget (for instance, 100.000 EUR) and then
every project has assigned a value (for instance, 10.000 EUR). Then when people vote on projects, they have a progress bar
where they see how much remaining budget they have to allocate in this voting.

From this starting point, there could be other configurations, such as:

* A minimum percentage of budget to be allocated
* A minimum number of projects to be allocated
* Multiple budgets, one for each district or neighborhood

Some examples of where this component was used:

* https://www.decidim.barcelona/processes/PressupostosParticipatius[2020/2021 Participatory Budgeting Process in Decidim Barcelona].
The  city of Barcelona (Spain) has allocated a budget of 30.000.000 EUR so people can present, define, prioritize, vote
and choose which investment projects the city goverment should execute.
* https://ecrivons.angers.fr/processes/BP2021[2021 Participatory Budgeting Process in Angers]. The city of Angers (France) has allocated
a budget of 1.000.000 EUR so people from 11 years can propose maximum of 3 ideas and then vote for their 5 favorite projects.
* https://omastadi.hel.fi/[2021 Participatory Budgeting Process in Helsinki]. Helsinki has allocated 8.8 million euros to realising
residents’ wishes. The ideas are developed together into proposals that Helsinki residents can vote on. The proposals with the
most votes are realised by the City.

== Workflows

One neat feature of the Budgets component is the ability to define your own workflows.

This means that you can define multiple Budgets, for instance one for every Neighberhood or District that a City has, and
you can also define multiple rullings regarding how people can vote on those Budgets. By default you have these workflows:

* Vote in one: allows participants to vote in any budget, but only in one.
* Vote in all: allows participants to vote in all budgets.
* Vote in a random component: allows participants to vote only in one budget, selected randomly.

But this can be extended in your application by a developer, by making your own Workflows. For instance for the
https://www.decidim.barcelona/processes/PressupostosParticipatius[2020/2021 Participatory Budgeting Process in Decidim Barcelona],
the people could vote in two districts: the one where they lived and one of their choosing. This was defined in the
https://github.com/AjuntamentdeBarcelona/decidim-barcelona/blob/743be2a210e8745d2dc443166642b285aed2b356/lib/budgets_workflow_pam2021.rb[decidim-barcelona application itself].

You can read more about Worfklows in https://github.com/decidim/decidim/blob/1ab5cd8fdabef48f5be94ff9c30c6bb3bc9a2f8f/decidim-budgets/README.md#budget-workflows[decidim-budgets README.md].

NOTE: You only want to have a voting without much complications? Like a city-wide vote? Don't worry: if you define only one
Budget, then people will go there directly when click in the Budgets section.
