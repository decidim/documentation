= Registrations

Through registrations you can have capacity control of the attendance for a meeting. With this feature for instance you can
limit how many people could attend to the meeting, or you can know before the start of a meeting if you need to find a bigger
room to have the meeting.

Enabling this feature will add a button so that participants can express their wish to go to the meeting. Depending in how
this feature is configured, then:

. it's possible to define how many slots are available for controling the maximum capacity for this meeting
. a xref:_registration_form[custom registration form] for asking information to participants can be configured
. administrators can make xref:_invitations[invitations] to other participants or people that isn't registered in the platform
. it's possible to control attendance to the meeting through xref:_registration_code[registration codes]

Once participants confirm joining a meeting they get asked if they're reprensenting a group and if they want to show publicly that they're attending.
