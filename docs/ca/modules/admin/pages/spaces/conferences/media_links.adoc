= Media links

Conferences can have a section called "Media and links". It shows a list of media files and links that are associated to the conference.

The media files are the files from the xref:admin:spaces/conferences/attachments.adoc[attachments] sections.
The media links are defined in a section in the admin panel of the conference.
