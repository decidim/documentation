= Process groups

A group of processes proves useful for subdividing large participatory processes into subprocesses according to a criteria,
for instance the xref:admin:scopes.adoc[scope] of every process.

As an example you can see the https://www.decidim.barcelona/processes_groups/4[Barcelona City Council's Neighborhoods Plan, Pla de Barris].
This is is a 150 million euro shock plan that aims to reduce inequalities within the city. There are 10 related processes, one for each involved neighborhood.
