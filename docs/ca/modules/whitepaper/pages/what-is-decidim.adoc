Decidim [http://decidim.org[http://decidim.org]], from the Catalan "let's decide" or “we decide”, is a digital platform for participatory democracy.
More specifically, Decidim is a web environment (a _framework_) produced in _Ruby on Rails_ (a programming language) that allows anybody to create and configure a website to be used in the form of a political network for democratic participation. It is built entirely and collaboratively as https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software[free software].

The platform allows any organization (local city council, association, university, NGO, neighbourhood or cooperative) to create mass processes for strategic planning, participatory budgeting, public consultation, collaborative design, etc. It also makes possible to connect traditional in-person democratic meetings with the digital world: sending meeting invites, managing registrations, facilitating the publication of minutes, etc.
In addition, Decidim enables the structuring of government bodies or assemblies (councils, boards, working groups), the convening of consultations, referendums or channelling citizen or member initiatives to trigger different decision-making processes. Yet, the Decidim project is much more than that.

*Definition*: _Decidim is a public-common’s, free and open, digital infrastructure for participatory democracy_.

- By “participatory democracy” we mean that form of “government of the people, for the people and by the people” in which people take part as equals or peers (from latin _pars_, part, and _capere_, to take). By taking part we mean that, under the current political model, people take the part _of_ the sovereign power that belongs to them. And this should be an equal part for each. Moreover, we also mean, under an alternative model, to take part _in_ the autonomy of the social and political life, in the construction of collective potency: the capacity to coordinate and commit to collective action.
- The term “digital infrastructure” makes reference to a set of tools, resources, data-sets, documents, codes (legal, computer, etc.), interfaces and services that are digitalized or made accessible by digital means. This infrastructure is primarily a software platform for participatory democracy.

 Participants can create proposals, sign and support them, comment, receive notifications, attend public meetings or receive the minutes of the session. Administrators can design participatory processes, define the structure of democratic organs (like councils or committees), configure types of initiatives or set up consultations. The infrastructure also includes documentation, design (icons, images, logos, etc.), legal documents, datasets or training resources, among others. All these make possible to deploy a participatory democratic system in any organization (be it a municipality, a cooperative, an association, a union or a community).
- By “free and open” we mean that the project’s goods (the assets of the infrastructure) do no fall under the form of private property that excludes others from accessing, using, copying, modifying and re-publishing or reusing these resources but, instead, displays all the legal, technical and social means necessary to share them and open them to collaboration.
- Finally, the term “public-commons” indicates that the project is mostly financed and made possible by public institutions and is managed and designed by an open community constituted by public-servants, members of different associations, university researchers and students, activists and staff from foundations, workers from different companies or simply volunteers that commit to the principles of the project. For this infrastructure to be a common’s it is important that these partners organize democratically in relation to the project. In this sense, Decidim is a reflexive infrastructure that uses the very infrastructure to democratize itself through the MetaDecidim community.

*Platform features and functional architecture*. Since the digital platform displays and embodies both the means of project organization and its democratic principles, it is important to explain how the platform works. Users of the platform (participants) interact through participatory mechanisms known as _components_ within different participatory _spaces_ that channel their democratic power to specific results. Participatory spaces are the frameworks that define how participation will be carried out, the _channels_ or means through which citizens or members of an organization can process requests or coordinate proposals and make decisions. _Initiatives_, _Processes_, _Assemblies_ and _Consultations_ are all participatory spaces. Specific examples of each of these include: a citizen initiative for directly changing a regulation (_Initiative_); a general assembly or workers’ council (_Assembly_); a participatory budgeting, strategic planning, or electoral process (_Processes_); a referendum or call to vote “Yes” or “No” to change the name of an organization (_Consultation_). The more notable components that are combined into spaces to deliver participatory mechanisms include in-person _meetings_, _proposals_, _blogs, debates, static information pages, surveys_, _results_ and _comments_. So, for example, the various phases of a participatory budgeting process (where members of an organization are called to decide how to spend a budget) can combine components in the following way: at an early phase, public meetings can be opened for citizens to analyze different needs classified by districts. In turn these meetings can lead to the design of a survey. The survey results can next be used to define a set of categories for projects to be proposed. The proposal component might then be activated for participants to create and publish their projects as solutions to the identified needs. These proposals can be commented on. After a period of deliberation, the voting component can be activated to select among the projects using a budget-expenditure system. Participants can then be called to a public meeting to evaluate the results and an assessment survey can then be launched for those who could not attend the meeting. Finally, the accountability component can be activated to monitor the degree of execution of the selected projects and people can comment on it. This is but one example of how components are combined in a space, but there are many other combinatorial possibilities. What makes Decidim particularly powerful is this combination of components within spaces, which provides an organization with a complete toolkit to easily design and deploy a democratic system adapted to its needs.

*The social contract*: All members and partners of the Decidim project must endorse and follow a “https://decidim.org/contract[social contract]” that defines a set of guiding principles. The social contract can be summarized as follows: 1. _Free software and open content_: Decidim will always remain free and open to collaboration, without legal or technical obstacles for the use, copy and modification. To ensure this we use a set of licenses: https://www.gnu.org/licenses/agpl-3.0.html[Affero GPLv3] for the code, https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/[CreativeCommons By-SA] for the content (text, images, design, etc.) and https://opendatacommons.org/licenses/odbl/1-0/[Open Access Database License] for data. This means that Decidim will always remain auditable, collaborable, transparent, appropriable and trustworthy, all of which is fundamental for a democratic infrastructure. 2. _Transparency, traceability and integrity_: the content of participation will always remain transparent, traceable and integral. This means that all the content must be accessible and downloadable, it should always be known what happens with each proposal, its origin, where it was incorporated or why it was rejected, and the content needs to be displayed without been manipulated, any modification (if required) must be registered and be accessible and auditable. 3. _Equal opportunities, democratic quality and inclusiveness_: the platform must guarantee the democratic quality, the non-discrimination and equal opportunities for each participant and proposals, including objective indicators. The platform must comply with accessibility standards, its use must favour the integration of online and offline participation and organizations must deploy the means for mediation and training of participants. 4. _Privacy with verification_: participants must retain privacy of their personal data combined with verification. Personal data should never be displayed, nor sold or transferred to third parties while, at the same time, the unicity and democratic rights of participants must be preserved (meaning there cannot be two verified users corresponding to the same individual with democratic rights and all participants with such rights must be verifiable). 5. _Democratic commitment, responsibility and collaboration_: institutions using Decidim must commit to respond on time, be accountable for decisions taken through the platform, and to openly collaborate on its improvement.

*Instances*. The best known and intensively used instance of Decidim, as a digital platform for participatory democracy, is https://decidim.barcelona[www.decidim.barcelona], with (as of December 2018) more than 30,000 registered participants, more than 1.5 million page views, over 300,000 visitors, 35 participatory processes, 1,141 public meetings channelled through the platform and 13,297 proposals, out of which over 9,196 have already become public policies grouped into 5,485 results whose implementation level can be monitored by citizens. The instance that actively explores more functionalities is http://meta.decidim.org[meta.decidim.org], the community portal that designs and supports the project. There is also a demo site with the latest version available for exploration and a training instance open to anybody to learn how to configure, administrate and use the platform. There are currently more than 70 instances of Decidim for organizations of different sorts ranging from municipalities such as https://osallistu.hel.fi/[Helsinki] or https://erabaki.pamplona.es/[Pamplona], to regional governments like the https://participa.castillalamancha.es/[Junta de Castilla la Mancha] or the https://participa.gencat.cat/[Generalitat de Catalunya], national governments like the https://monopinion.belgium.be[Belgium Federal State], NGO networks such as https://assembly.fundaction.eu[Fundaction] or https://participa.quorumglobal.org/[QuorumGlobal], cooperatives like https://participa.somenergia.coop/[Som Energia], or the https://participons.debatpublic.fr/[National Commission for Public Debate] (_Commission Nationale du Débat Public_) in France. We have an https://decidim-monitor.herokuapp.com[online monitoring tool] that captures the relevant public data of known Decidim instances around the world.

*A sustainable ecosystem*. Developed at Barcelona’s http://ajuntament.barcelona.cat/innovaciodemocratica/en[Laboratory for Democratic Innovation], Decidim is the result of the joint effort of a network of collaborating entities and multiple participants leaded by Barcelona’s City Council. Apart from the organizations that use the platform and whose participants and administrators report bugs and suggest improvements, there is a network of 17 different collaborating entities, from software companies to institutional consortia, from research institutions to civil associations. The https://meta.decidim.barcelona/[Metadecidim] community uses an instance of the Decidim platform to organize the different dimensions of the project. As of August 7th 2018 it has 379 registered participants, it hosts minutes of 126 public meetings, details of eight assemblies or working groups, four participatory processes (welcome process, bug reporting, feature proposals, and training workshop process) together with various initiatives and two consultations aimed at defining the roadmap and software design of the platform, bug reporting, community and project governance, research and development. Official documentation and code are developed on https://github.com/decidim[Github] where the project hosts more than 20 repositories with over 50 contributors. They all together generate a sustainable ecosystem that governs, produces and provides services over the platform (deployment, adaptation, configuration, training, consultancy, administration, etc.).

*Democracy and social empowerment*: Decidim was born in an institutional environment (that of Barcelona City Council during Ada Colau’s mandate 2015-2019 and under the impulse of Gala Pin councillor for participatory democracy), directly aiming at improving and enhancing the political and administrative impact of participatory democracy in the state (municipalities, local governments, etc.). But it also aims at empowering social processes as _a platform for massive social coordination for collective action_ independently of public administrations. Anybody can copy, modify and install Decidim for its own needs, so Decidim is by no means reduced to public institutions. There are different ways in which participatory democracy infrastructures can boost social, economic and political self-organization. Decidim is starting to be used for these purposes: for the internal organization of consumer and producer cooperatives for example, it is also helping movements organize and to design strategic planning, and it might soon be used to coordinate massive strikes or other forms of social action. The modular nature of its architecture is also enabling these organizations to develop their own components and improvements (such as crowdfunding, membership management, etc.) and to plug them back into Decidim, expanding its potential. Decidim comes to fill the gap of public and common’s platforms, providing an alternative to the way in which private platforms coordinate social action (mostly with profit-driven, data extraction and market-oriented goals). Ultimately, Decidim aims to present an alternative to the existing model of digital economy sponsored by corporate digital platforms (Amazon, AirBnB, Uber, etc).

*The political, the technical and the technopolitical*. As we have repeatedly stressed, Decidim is more than a technological platform. It has required to assemble a variety of codes, realities and dimensions that go beyond programming code. We define it as a “technopolitical project” where legal, political, institutional, practical, social, educational, communicative, economic and epistemic codes merge together. Ultimately, Decidim is in itself a sort of crossroad of the various dimensions of networked democracy and society, a detailed practical map of their complexities and conflicts. We distinguish three general planes or dimensions of the project: the _political_ (focused on the democratic model that Decidim promotes and its impact on public policies and organizations), the _technopolitical_ (focused on how the platform is designed, the mechanisms it embodies, and the way in which it is itself democratically designed), and the _technical_ (focused on the conditions of production, operation and success of the project: the digital factory, collaborative mechanisms, licenses, etc.). The political plane is best illustrated by the use of Decidim in a city or organization, the type of democratic processes and decisions that are made through it. In other words, it covers what kind of politics can be done using Decidim: what kind of governance, conflict and power relationships can be channelled through it, thus, the kind of democracy it is capable to produce. Its model instance is decidim.barcelona, what happens within, how it alters the political space of the city. The second plane, the technopolitical, includes matters concerning the digital architectural design of Decidim: its interfaces, features, design principles, data policies, user experience, etc. It is a primarily a reflexive space of how technologies structure political processes. It is embodied in the Metadecidim platform and the community that surrounds it. Finally, the technical plane encompasses issues concerning primarily the programming and legal codes (information and legal infrastructures), but is also includes issues of education and knowledge (epistemic infrastructures), spatial and working organization. All three dimensions are part of the project.

.Systematization footnote:[We have chosen Barcelona here as a scale of reference, but it could be the EU, or any other political territory or democratic organization. The term “scale” does not refer here to territorial extension, but to the number of agents and organizational complexity: the political involves more complexity, more agents, more conflict, more diversity and width of decision to be made, the technopolitical is a smaller community scale, the technical is a laboratory or factory that covers a subset of this community.] of various aspects of the Decidim project in the political, technopolitical and technical planes with the city of Barcelona as a reference.
