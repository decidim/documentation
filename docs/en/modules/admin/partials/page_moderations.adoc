= Moderation

Moderations inside of a space work like xref:global_moderations.adoc[Global moderations].

The main difference is that if you want so you can invite Moderators of this specific
space and they will only have access to the reports made for
contents of this space.

Moderators are a kind of space admins. See it for instance for xref:spaces/processes/admins.adoc[participatory processes admins].
