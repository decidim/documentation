= Badges

Badges are recognitions to participant actions and progress in the platform. As participants start discovering, participating,
and interacting in the platform, they earn different badges. Here is the list of badges and some ways participants can earn them.

It is a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification[gamification] mechanism to improve the engagement of the participants in a playful way.

The badges a participant has are visible in her account. There's also a general explanation page with a short description of every badge.

When a participant earns a badge she receives a notification.

Badges have multiple levels, depending in the number of times she has made the action. For instance, for Proposals badge
she'll receive the first level badge when arriving at 1 follower, the second level at 15 followers, the third level at 30 followers,
the fourth level at 60 and the fifth level at 100.
