= Notifications

In this section, participants can see notifications that the system has sent to them. For instance, if the participant is following a participatory space or a proposal, they get related notifications about the actions that happen in these sections of the platform.

The participant accesses this section through the bell icon in the header bar of the platform. The bell icon shows highlighted as active when there are notifications, and dimmer when there are no new notifications for the user at that time.
