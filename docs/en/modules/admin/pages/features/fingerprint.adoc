= Fingerprint

Although the platform should show the xref:admin:features/versions.adoc[Versions] for almost all of the content, it would be
still possible to manipulate the content by directly editing the database.

As mitigation for this risk, the platform shows a fingerprint for some important fields, for instance, a proposal body and title.

Its goal is to provide a way to give an informal 'receipt' to a participant to they can detect tampering. A fingerprint is
a hashed representation of the content. It is useful to ensure there has been no tampering with content, as a single modification
would result in a totally different value. A SHA256 hashing algorithm calculates the fingerprint. In order to replicate it
yourself, you can use a http://www.md5calc.com/sha256[MD5 calculator online] and copy-paste the source data.

== Check fingerprint

. Go to the content that you want to verify the fingerprint for
. Click on the 'Check fingerprint' link in the sidebar

. Follow the modal instructions

It is possible to verify the fingerprint with other tools, such as the sha256sum command line tool.
