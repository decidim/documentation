= Metrics

NOTE: Looking for how to enable this feature technically? Go to xref:develop:metrics.adoc[Metrics in Developers guide]

With Metrics, participants can see the evolution in time of some resources, such as proposals, supports, endorsements, followers, participants, accepted proposals, comments, etc. You can see a real world example of this in https://meta.decidim.org/processes/roadmap/all-metrics[Metadecidim Roadmap process].

For this to work, it needs to be first xref:develop:metrics.adoc[configured technically], and also turned on by the setting in the participatory space - 'Show metrics' checkbox.

Then this section is visible in the space landing page.
