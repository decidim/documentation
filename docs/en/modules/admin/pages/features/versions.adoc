= Versions

The versions feature allows a visitor to see the evolution of the different versions of resources which are editable,
like proposals or results.

With versions it is possible to see who made the change, when, and exactly what has changed.

It is possible to view the diffs of the versions in two formats: side by side or unified. If the contents are
in HTML, then it is also possible to see the diff un-escaped and escaped, and see the full HTML code.
