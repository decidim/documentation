= Notifications

Most of the actions in the platform generate notifications, so participants can know when there are new things to review.

This is accessible from the 'Notifications' menu item - image:icon_bell.png[Notification icon] - in the header, after a participant has logged in.

To see the notifications:

. Sign in as participant
. Click on the notifications icon in the header

If there are notifications, then the participant sees the icon highlighted image:icon_bell_on.png[Notification icon with highlight]
