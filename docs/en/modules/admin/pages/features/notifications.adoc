= Notifications

== The notification menu

Most of the actions in the platform generate notifications so particpants can know when there are new things to watch.

This is accessible from the `Notifications` menu item (image:icon_bell.png[Notification icon]) in the header, after a participant has logged in.

To see the notifications:

. Sign in as participant
. Click in the notifications icon in the header

If there are notifications, then the participant will see the icon with a color image:icon_bell_on.png[Notification icon with color]
