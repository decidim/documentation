= Follows

Most of the content in Decidim allows users to follow updates. This means that you receive xref:features/notifications.adoc[notifications]
of the activity from the thing you're following.

You can control these notifications in the xref:features/my_account/notifications_settings.adoc[settings of your account].

The activity of the things that you're following is visible in your xref:features/my_public_profile/timeline.adoc[profile timeline].

For following a thing:

. Navigate to whatever you want to follow.
. Click on the 'Follow' button.

Administrators by default follow all the new spaces created in the Decidim platform.

A participant can also follow another participants. This is public and it is visible in the profile sections
