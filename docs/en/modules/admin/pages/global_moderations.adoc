= Global moderations

The *Global moderations* function allows you to moderate different kind of contents and
ensure that the dialog in your platform is democratic and constructive. Making
use of this function, administrators, collaborators and moderators of a space can
hide the contents/contributions that have been reported, where the complaint is
deemed appropriate, or delete the complaint.

NOTE: Looking for how to report users? See xref:participants/reported_users.adoc[Reported users].

For instance, in the case of https://www.decidim.barcelona/[Decidim Barcelona],
the https://www.decidim.barcelona/pages/terms-and-conditions[Terms of Service] says:

> It is not allowed to add any illegal or unauthorized content to the site, such
as information with the following features:
>
> * be it false or misleading;
> * to infringe any law of the City Council or any third party, such as copyright,
trademarks or other intellectual and industrial property rights or related rights;
> * attacking the privacy of a third party, such as publishing personal details
of participants, such as name, address, phone number, email, photos or any other
personal information;
> * containing viruses, Trojans, robots or other programs that may harm the website
or the City Hall systems, or the website or system of any third party, or which

offensive meaning or character;

Anyone can propose a moderation in Decidim, through the "Flag" icon in the participant
profile. After a participant has clicked in this action then she needs to provide a
reason why she's making this report:

* Contains clickbait, advertising, scams or script bots.
* Contains racism, sexism, slurs, personal attacks, death threats, suicide requests or any form of hate speech.
* Contains illegal activity, suicide threats, personal information, or something else you think doesn't belong on [This organization].

Participants can also add extra information regarding their report.

After a participant has reported a content, it'll be shown in two sections of the
administration panel:

* Global moderations panel
* Participatory space moderation panel

To go to the Global moderations panel, you need to:

. Sign in as administrator
. Go to administration panel
. Click in Global moderations in the sidebar

There you'll find first all the unprocessed reports if there's any:

It's also possible to filter by the type of content that was moderated and the
state of the reported content (if it was hidden or not).

* *Id*: unique identificator of the reported content.
* *Type*: which kind of content it was reported, for instance a *Proposal* or a *Comment*.
* *Participatory Space*: which space this content belongs to.
* *Count*: Number of times it has been reported by different users.
* *Reported content URL*: link for seeing the content reported and see the context of the complaint.
* *Reports*: why it has been reported. If the participant that made the report has given extra
information it's possible to see it by hovering it.
* *Creation date*: when it was originally reported.
* *Actions*: you can *Expand*, *Unreport* or *Hide*.
