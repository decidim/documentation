= Amendments

With the amendment feature, participants can propose changes to an already published proposal.

It is useful to propose improvements or corrections, and especially useful when redacting laws or regulations with xref:components/proposals/participatory_texts.adoc[Participatory Texts].

It has similarities with xref:components/proposals/collaborative_drafts.adoc[Collaborative Drafts], but the main difference
is that with amendments there is no need to trust the other authors intentions, as the original author reviews and approves every change.
