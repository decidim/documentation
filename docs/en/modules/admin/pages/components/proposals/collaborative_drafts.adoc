= Collaborative draft

With the collaborative draft feature participants can make a proposal with multiple authors.

It is useful to propose improvements or corrections.

It has similarities with xref:components/proposals/amendments.adoc[Amendments] but the main difference is that with collaborative
drafts there is a need to trust other authors, as they can make any change to the original proposal without approval by the
original author, although the original author can decide if she promotes the collaborative draft as a proposal.

. Lucian goes to the collaborative draft. There she can accept or reject the collaboration request

. Lucian approves the collaboration request. Once approved, you cannot decline the request
. Now the collaborative draft has multiple authors

. Rosario can edit the collaborative draft by clicking in the 'Edit collaborative draft' button

. Once satisfied with the collaborative draft, Lucian can publish it by clicking the 'Publish' button
image:components/proposals/collaborative_drafts/publish_modal.png[]
. When published, it becomes a proposal,

. And the collaborative draft is still visible although editing is no longer possible.
