== Publication

You can control the publish date of answers by using the 'Publish proposal answers immediately' checkbox.

For enabling automatic publication, you'll need to select it.

On the other hand, if you want to control when to publish the answer for a proposal or multiple proposals, you'll need to follow these steps:

. Sign in as administrator or valuator
. Go to the administrator panel
. In the main sidebar, click in the button for the space where the proposal you wish to publish answers for resides.
For instance, it could be 'Processes', 'Assemblies', or 'Conferences'
. Click in the 'Proposals' component
. Search the proposal you want to answer
. Click in the left checkbox of the proposal that you want to publish
. Click on the 'Actions' button
. Click on the 'Publish answers' option
image:components/proposals/proposal_answer_publish.png[Proposal answer publication: action]
. Click on 'Publish' button

NOTE: If you have unchecked the 'Publish proposal answers immediately', answered the proposals and then checked the option again, the answers are not
published automatically. You still need to publish the answers manually with the 'Actions' button.
