= Participatory texts

This feature allows you to navigate the proposals as text. It is useful for discussing regulations, plans, or other kinds of texts.

Decidim splits each paragraph into a proposal, so it is possible to discuss it in a more granular way.

An example of this feature in use includes:

pass:[<!-- vale Vale.Spelling = NO -->]

// The non-english text here throws an error, so we temporarily turn off Vale for this part.

pass:[<!-- vale Vale.Spelling = YES -->]

. Publish the proposal component

Notice that this feature could break existing proposals, so you cannot use it if there is any proposal in existence already. If this is the case, the
following message displays in the components settings:

====
Cannot interact with this setting if there are existing proposals. Please, create a new `Proposals component` if you want
to enable this feature or discard all imported proposals in the `Participatory Texts` menu if you want to disable it.
====

== Add document form

Although it is possible to work with both Markdown (.MD) and ODT (.ODT) files, Decidim recommends working with Markdown as it is
easier to see the formatting.
