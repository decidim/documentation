= Participatory texts

This feature allows you to navigate the proposals as text. It's useful for discussing normatives, plans, or other kinds of texts.

Every paragraph is split into a proposal, so it's possible to discuss it in a more granular way.

Some examples of where this feature was used are:

. Publish the proposal component

Notice that this feature could break existing proposals, so if there is any proposal it will not work. You'll see the
following message in the components settings:

====
Cannot interact with this setting if there are existing proposals. Please, create a new `Proposals component` if you want
to enable this feature or discard all imported proposals in the `Participatory Texts` menu if you want to disable it.
====

== Add document form

Although it's possible to work with both Markdown (.MD) and ODT (.ODT) files, we recommend working with Markdown as it's
easier to see the formatting.
