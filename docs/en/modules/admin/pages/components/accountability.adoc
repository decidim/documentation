= Accountability

The Accountability component allows people to follow project implementations. It works like a project management system built into the platform. It offers the following features:

* creating results that represent projects to be implemented
* subdividing results into projects or sub-projects
* defining and applying progress in implementation statuses (0% to 100% implemented) around their implementation
* displaying the extent of the resultsâ€™ implementation grouped by categories and scopes

Results, projects and statuses can be updated through a CSV (comma-separated values), or manually by the administration interface.
