= Accountability

The Accountability component allows people to follow project implementations. It works like a project management system built into the platform. It offers the following features:

* creating results that represent projects in the process of implementation
* subdividing results into projects or sub-projects
* defining and applying progress in implementation statuses - 0% to 100% implemented - around their implementation
* displaying the extent of the results' implementation grouped by categories and scopes

You can update results, projects, and statuses through a CSV upload (comma-separated values), or manually by the administration interface.
