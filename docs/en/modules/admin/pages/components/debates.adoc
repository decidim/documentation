= Debate

The Debate component allows people to have discussions, without voting nor prioritization. It also allows to close them
by adding conclusions, or a summary of what the discussion was about.

From this starting point, there could be other configurations, such as:

* To allow debates creation by participants
* To have debates with a fixed started and ending date or open
* To show endorsements - public supports - or not

Some examples of this component in use:

* https://meta.decidim.org/processes/roadmap/f/219/[Propose new functionalities for Decidim software in Metadecidim]
