= Debate

The Debate component allows people to have discussions, without voting nor prioritzation. It also allows to close them,
by adding conclusions or a summary of what the discussion was about.

From this starting point, there could be other configurations, such as:

* To allow debates creation by participants
* To have debates with a fixed started and ending date or open
* To show endorsements (public supports) or not

Some examples of where this component was used:

* https://meta.decidim.org/processes/roadmap/f/219/[Propose new functionalities for Decidim software in Metadecidim]
