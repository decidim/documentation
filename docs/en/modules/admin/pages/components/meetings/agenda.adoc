= Agenda

The agenda feature allows an administrator to define the schedule for a meeting. It's possible to define agenda items and
sub-items, with every one of the topics that will be discussed in the meeting, along with a description and the duration
of every item and sub-item.

The only limitation that agenda items and sub-items have is that they have to respect the duration of the parent. For instance,
if there's an Item that lasts 60 minutes, you can't create a sub-item that lasts 90 minutes.
