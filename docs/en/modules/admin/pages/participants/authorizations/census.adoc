= Organization's census authorization

The process is as follows:

. Administrators upload a CSV with the emails of the accepted participants
. Participants go to their accounts and request verification
. Verification is only successful for participants with an email address matching the CSV file

Check all the CSV or file based authorizations in the https://decidim.org/modules/[Modules page].

== 1. An administrator uploads the CSV of the participants

In the administrator panel, the administrator can review the request by going to the 'Organization's census' in the 'Participants' section.
