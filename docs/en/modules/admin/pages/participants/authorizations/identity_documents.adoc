= Identity documents authorization

This authorization allows a participant to upload its identity documents. These documents depend on the organization,
they could be a driver's license, a passport, a national identity card, a club membership card, etc.

An administrator reviews these documents to accept or decline them. It is possible to do this process in two ways: online or offline.

* Online: the participant uploads the documents, and the administrator reviews these documents.
* Offline: the participant fills in some data, and then she'll need to go to a official place to show her documents face to face.

== Configuration

By clicking on the btn:[Config] button in this section, an administrator can configure the settings for this authorization.

NOTE: As you can see, the basis for this authorization method is the original implementers reality, in this case in the Spanish identities document types.

For instance, the options for document types include 'DNI, NIE, or Passport' or asking for 'Document number - with letter'
You can change this by xref:customize:code.adoc[code customizing or overriding] these things. xref:contribute:governance.adoc[Pull Request contributions] are also welcome, so it is possible to configure this.
