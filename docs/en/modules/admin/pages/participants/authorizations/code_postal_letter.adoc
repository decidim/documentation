= Code by postal letter authorization

This authorization allows a participant to request the sending of a verification code to their address, to confirm that she
lives or works in this place. She'll need to then fill the code in the platform.

The process is:

. Participants request the sending of a verification code to their address.
. An administrator sends the letter to their address with the verification code.
. An administrator marks the letter as sent.
. Once you mark the letter as sent, the participant can enter the code.
. If this code matches, then verification succeeds.

== 1. A participant requests the verification code

By going to the authorization section in their profile, or by clicking on the action button if requesting this permission,
a participant can see the form for filling in her full address to request the verification code.

If she tries to edit it, she'll see this message:

This is because the letter sending could be in progress. If the information requires correction, then the participant needs
to contact the organization directly.

== 2. An administrator reviews this request and sends the letter

In the administrator panel, the administrator can review the request by going to the 'Code by postal letter' in the 'Participants' section.

Here she can see the verification code and can send it to the participant by mail. After sending the code she can mark it
as sent with the icon image:action_mark_as_sent.png[Mark as sent]. It also shows the sending date of the letter.

== 3. A participant fills in the verification code

After the participant has received the code, she can go to account settings and Click on the 'Code by postal letter'
verification method.

Then she'll see the form for confirming the code.

== 4. The verification code matches, or not

If the verification code matches, then the participant sees the message 'Congratulations. You've been successfully verified'.

pass:[<!-- vale Google.We = NO -->]
pass:[<!-- vale Google.WordList = NO -->]


On the other hand, if the verification code does not match, then the participant sees the message "Your verification
code does not match ours. Please double-check the letter we sent to you."

pass:[<!-- vale Google.We = YES -->]
pass:[<!-- vale Google.WordList = YES -->]

Once verified, as with other verifications, she can see it in her account settings.
