# Reported users

There are cases where participants could go against the Terms of Service of the
platform, so it's useful to have the option for reporting and blocking users. You
can read more about how moderation and reporting contents work in xref:global_moderations.adoc[Global moderations].

A participant can be blocked from the xref:participants/participants.adoc[participants
section in the admin panel] or through this "Reported users" section.

Anyone can propose a moderation in Decidim, through the "Flag" icon in the participant
profile. After a participant has clicked in this action she needs to provide a
reason why she's making this report:

* Contains clickbait, advertising, scams or script bots.
* Contains racism, sexism, slurs, personal attacks, death threats, suicide requests
or any form of hate speech.
* Contains illegal activity, suicide threats, personal information, or something
else you think doesn't belong on Demo.
* Other (and add it)

After clicking in this option you'll need to provide a justification why you're
blocking this participant:

Once a blocked participant tries to log-in she'll see an error message:

After a participant was blocked its name is changed to "Blocked user".
