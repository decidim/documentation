= Areas

include::partial$deprecated.adoc[]

Areas are all the sectors that an Organization can have.

They are pretty similar to xref:admin:scopes.adoc[scopes], meaning that they are a way of allowing a better navigation and filtering in the spaces and components.

We don't recommend using them, as probably in the future they will be removed.

You can read more information about the history of Areas in this https://github.com/decidim/decidim/issues/3540#issuecomment-427324532[GitHub comment].
