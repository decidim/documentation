= Dashboard

For your first time accessing to a Decidim plaform as Admin, you'll receive an invitation email so you can finish setting up your account with your nickname, name and password.

Once you've finished and you're logged-in, you'll be able to access the Admin panel, starting with the Dashboard page. For this you'll need to click on your username, and click on "Admin dashboard".

Here, you'll have a summary of the last activity of the platform.
