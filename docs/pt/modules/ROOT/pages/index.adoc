= Welcome to Decidim Documentation

This is the documentation site to Decidim, a participatory democracy platform created initially by Barcelona City Hall.

Decidim is a framework that allows anybody to create and configure a website platform, to be used in the form of a political network for democratic participation. The platform allows any organization (local city council, association, university, NGO, neighbourhood or cooperative) to create mass processes for strategic planning, participatory budgeting, collaborative design for regulations, urban spaces and election processes.
