= Registration types

You can enable registrations in conferences, so it's easier to register to the whole conference, or by days, rather than
going meeting by meeting to enable registration for that particular event.

After enabling registrations participants will have a button to register to the conference in the landing and the conference's header.

If you want to enable registration you'll need to define and publish at least one registration type.
