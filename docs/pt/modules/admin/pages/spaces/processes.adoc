= Processes

A participatory process is a sequence of participatory activities (e.g. first filling out a survey, then making proposals,
discussing them in face-to-face or virtual meetings, and finally prioritizing them) with the aim of defining and making a decision on a specific topic.

Examples of participatory processes are: a process of electing committee members (where candidatures are first presented,
then debated and finally a candidacy is chosen), participatory budgets (where proposals are made, valued economically,
and voted on with the money available), a strategic planning process, the collaborative drafting of a regulation or norm,
the design of an urban space or the production of a public policy plan.

A really important concept for making good use of Decidim is to understand the relationship between Phases and Components
in a participatory process in Decidim:

image::process_steps_components.png[Relation between Steps and Components in a Process in Decidim]

What this diagram is showing is that for a participatory process you can have 7 phases:

. Configuration & Presentation
. Diagnostic
. Proposal Creation
. Proposal Selection
. Results
. Evaluation
. Monitoring

Inside of every one of these Phases, there are some components (like Blog, Meetings, Survey, Debates, Proposals, Results).
Some of these Components allow some features depending on the Phase that we are.

In this section, we'll explain how we can configure a Participatory Process in Decidim.

== List

To configure participatory processes on the Decidim platform, click on btn:[Processes] in the admin sidebar menu. A list
will appear with the existing processes if there are any:

image::processes_list.png[Participatory processes list]

You can filter by the ones that are:

* Published / Unpublished
* Public / Private

image::processes_list_filter.png[Participatory processes list filtered]

You can also search by title and control how many elements are in the list.

You have 4 possible actions in this list after a Participatory Process is created:

1. Export: send by email the configuration for a given process. Can be imported in other Decidim installation.
1. Duplicate: to duplicate this process.
1. Configure: to edit the metadata and configuration for a process.
1. Preview: how it will look once published.
