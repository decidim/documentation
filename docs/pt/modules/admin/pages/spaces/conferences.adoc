= Conferences

A conference is a collection of meetings arranged in a program, with a number of people invited as speakers, and other
information fields typical of large congresses or social events (registration, list of organizations that support or sponsor the
event, etc.). A conference can be a relevant event for an organization and its members, or take place as part of a participatory
process or follow a consultation.

Examples:

* A general assembly for an organization
* The annual meeting of a cooperative

As a real world example you can see the anual Metadecidim conferences:

== Creating the program

For creating the program of the conference you need to create a new xref:components/meetings.adoc[Meeting component] with the
dates and times of the different talks, workshops, sessions, etc. After publishing the meetings, it will be visible in the landing page
and there'll be a special navigation for these meetings so they're ordered by date and time.
