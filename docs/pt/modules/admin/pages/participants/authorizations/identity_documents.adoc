= Identity documents authorization

This authorization allows a participant to upload its identity documents. These documents depend on the organization,
they could be a driver's license, a passport, a national identity card, a club membership card, etc.

These documents will be reviewed by an administrator to accept or reject them. It's possible to do this process in two ways: Online or Offline.

* Online: the participant will be asked to upload the documents, and the administrator will review these documents.
* Offline: the participant will be asked to fill in some data, and then she'll need to go to a presential place to show her documents face to face.

== Configuration

By clicking on the btn:[Config] button in this section, an administrator can configure the settings for this authorization.

NOTE: As you can see, this authorization is based in the original implementers reality, in this case in the Spanish identities document types.
For instance, we're giving as options for document types "DNI, NIE or Passport" or we're asking for "Document number (with letter)"
You can change this by xref:customize:code.adoc[code customizing or overriding] these things. We also accept xref:contribute:governance.adoc[Pull Request contributions]
so it's possible to configure this.
