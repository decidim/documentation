= Proposals

The Proposals component allows people to create, comment, endorse, and give support to proposals.

From this starting point, there could be other configurations, such as:

* how many proposals a participant can create
* how many supports as a maximum a participant can give to proposals
* how many supports as a minimum a participant must give to proposals so their supports are valid
* whether you want to enable that participants comment on proposals
* whether you want that proposals have images, attachments, WYSIWYG editor, geolocated address, scopes, etc.

Some examples of where this component was used:

* https://futureu.europa.eu/[Conference of the Future of Europe]
* https://meta.decidim.org/processes/roadmap/f/122/[Propose new functionalities for Decidim software] in https://meta.decidim.org/[Metadecidim]

Proposals can be created by participants if the setting is "Proposal creation enabled" is checked for the active phase.

If a participant belongs to a xref:admin:groups.adoc[user group], then she'll be able to create proposals as that group also.

This form depends a lot in which settings you've enabled in this component. It can be really short (with only a Title and
Body by default) or very long (Title, Body, Hashtags, Address, Scope, Category, Image and Attachment).

.New proposal form - default (by a participant)
|===
|Field |Type |Description

|What is the full description for this proposal. Must have at least 15 characters as minimum and 450 characters as maximum
by default but can be changed with the setting "Maximum proposal body length".

To detect duplicated proposals before publishing them, the proposal creation has a wizard form with multiple steps. This also
allows participants to save proposals drafts (unpublished) in case they need to fill too many fields.

As an example of what the form could look depending in the settings enabled, here's a screenshot of the form for a proposal
