= Amendments

With the amendment feature, participants can propose changes to an already published proposal.

It's useful to propose improvements or corrections, specially useful when redacting laws or normatives with xref:components/proposals/participatory_texts.adoc[Participatory Texts].

It has similarities with xref:components/proposals/collaborative_drafts.adoc[Collaborative Drafts], but the main difference
is that with amendments there is no need to trust the other authors intentions, as every change is reviewed and must be
approved by the author of the original proposal.
