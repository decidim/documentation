= Accountability

The Accountability component allows people who visit the platform to view the level of execution (global, by categories and/or subcategories),
of the results of a participatory space. It allows to keep track of the results or decisions made in the platform,
and also to relate them to the proposals and meetings that helped to make them.

The results can be converted into projects or decomposed into subprojects. Administrators can define execution status,
ranging from 0% to 100%. The results, projects and states can be updated manually through the admin panel or through a CSV.

You can see an example of the Accountability component in the https://www.decidim.barcelona/processes/pam/f/8/[2016-2019 Municipal Action Plan (Pla d'Actuació Municipal 2016-2019) in Decidim Barcelona].

We recommend that you follow these steps:

. Create the xref:_statuses[Statuses] for the Results that you want to add
. Create at least one xref:_new_result[Result] manually through this Admin panel before using Import, for having a better understanding of
the format and what you'll need to fill out.
. Download the xref:_export_all[Export with CSV format]
. Make the changes locally. You can only change the following columns of the CSV:
** category/id: ID for the Category
** scope/id: ID for the Scope
** parent/id: ID of the parent (for related Results). Optional
** title/I18N: Title on X language
** description/I18N: Description on X language
** start_date: date when the result starts execution (format YYYY-MM-DD)
** end_date: date when the result ends execution (format YYYY-MM-DD)
** status/id: ID of the Status for this result
** progress: Percentage (from 0 to 100) of the execution
** proposals_ids: internal ID of the related proposals (separated with a comma). It gets automatically converted to proposal_url
