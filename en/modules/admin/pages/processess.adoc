A window with general information on the process will open and the process's submenu will appear, allowing you to configure the process's stages, functions, categories, users, moderations and attached information.

[[h.4k668n3]]
=== Stages of the process

A participatory process will be reflected on the Decidim platform at different stages, each with a start date and finish date, both pre-established at the beginning, so that citizens are clear about where the process is at and how they can take part in it at any time.

As a guideline, the standard structure of a participatory process may be as follows: Stage 1: presentation; Stage 2: diagnosis; Stage 3: proposal creation and debate; Stage 4: prioritisation of proposals; Stage 5: selection of results; Stage 6: assessment; Stage 7: monitoring.

To configure the stages of the process, click on *Steps* in the *PARTICIPATORY PROCESS* submenu and then click *NEW*. A *NEW PARTICIPATORY PROCESS STEP* window will open (<<new-participatory-process-step-fig>>).

You need to enter the following for each of the stages:

* *Title*
* *Description*
* *Start date and end date*

Once you have done that, click on *Create*.

[#new-participatory-process-step-fig]
._New participatory process step_.
image::image32.png[image]

To activate the stage the process is at, click on *Steps* from the *PARTICIPATORY PROCESS* submenu. A window will open showing all the stages of the process that have been configured and the icons that enable you to *Activate*, *Edit* and *Destroy* each of them. Click on *Activate* at the corresponding stage (<<process-steps-fig>>).

[#process-steps-fig]
._Process steps_.
image::image40.png[image]

Users will be able to display the various stages and descriptions that have been configured, by clicking on *View steps* (in the flag image, on the right). The stage that is active will be highlighted in red (<<displaying-steps-of-the-participating-user-process-fig>>).

[#displaying-steps-of-the-participating-user-process-fig]
._Displaying steps of the participating user process_.

[[h.2dlolyb]]
=== Categories

Categories (and subcategories) are used for classing contents within the various participatory spaces/ processes, as well as enabling users to filter contents. They are defined for each of the instances of the spaces.  For example, a participatory space can include several categories and subcategories and meetings, surveys, proposals and other components of the process can be classed under these categories. A category could be Environment and two of its subcategories Mobility and Air quality. <<categories-and-subcagetories-in-the-barcelona-PAM-for-20016-fig>> shows the categories and subcategories that were used in the participatory process for drafting the Barcelona Municipal Action Plan (PAM) for 2016.

[#categories-and-subcagetories-in-the-barcelona-PAM-for-20016-fig]
._Categories and subcategories in the Barcelona PAM for 2016_.
image::image65.png[image]

Note that once the categories have been defined, you cannot change them as they become the index that structures the contents inside a participation space. For example, if there is a participatory process for electing candidates, the categories could identify lists or types of candidacies. And where the process is for defining a Plan, the categories would coincide with the index for this Plan.

Note too that when it comes to classing contents, Decidim also allows scopes and labels (or tags) to be distinguished and configured. Unlike categories, (territorial or thematic) scopes are general throughout the platform and are defined during the configuration of the Decidim platform of the local authority/ entity.footnote:[On how to create scopes, see point 2.2.] Whereas labels (or tags) are freely defined by participants and can apply to any instance or component. The administration panel also allows you to create and nest labels.

For configuring categories, click on *Categories* in the *PARTICIPATIVE PROCESS* submenu. Then click on *NEW* below. You need to enter the following for each of the categories/ subcategories (<<new-category-fig>>): *Name* and *Description* and, where a subcategory is involved, select the category it corresponds to from the *Parent* drop-down menu. To finish, click on *Create category*.

[#new-category-fig]

[[h.hujj6qjwvw9u]]
=== Attachments: Collections and Files
When a participatory process is launched, it is important to provide citizens with as much information as possible about them so that they can participate with knowledge. That is why it is helpful to add files (Attachments) with the information that is considered relevant.

These documents can be classified/ grouped in *Collections*. For example, for a process of remodeling a place, collections could be created with information about possible uses, with plans, with economic information, etc.

First you need to create the collections to be able to place the attachments later. Click *Collections* in the submenu of the *PARTICIPATORY PROCESS*, the window is shown *ADVANCED COLLECTIONS* (<<attachment-collections-fig>>).

[#attachment-collections-fig]
._Attachment collections_.
image::image39.png[image]

Then click on *NEW* to create a new collection. Add *Name*, *Weight* and a *Description*. To finish, click *Create attachment* (<<new-collecion-fig>>).

[#new-collecion-fig]
._New collection_.
image::image17.png[image]

Once the collections have been created, the attachments can be added. Click *Files* in the sub-menu of the *PARTICIPATORY PROCESS* and click *NEW* to add the files. The *NEW ATTACHMENT* window opens (<<new-attachment-fig>>). Write the *Title* and the *Description*, select the *Weight* and the *Collection* which you want to associate the file, and upload the file by filling the *File* option. To finish click *Create attachment*.

[#new-attachment-fig]

[[h.2r0uhxc]]
=== Process' users

Authorisation may be given to other individuals, besides the platform’s general administrators, so that they can administer or collaborate in a certain process or moderate where there are contents that have been reported.

The process *administrators* can configure/ edit a process whereas *collaborators* can only see what is on the administrator menu of the process without being able to configure/ edit.

To register administrators, collaborators and/or moderators of a process, in the process's submenu, go to *Process users* and click on *NEW*.

A *NEW PARTICIPATORY PROCESS USER* window will open (<<new-participatory-process-user-fig>>).

[#new-participatory-process-user-fig]

image::image38.png[image]

You need to fill in the following fields: *Name*, *Email* and *Role* (select from the *Administrator*, *Collaborator* or *Moderator* drop-down menu). Click on *Create* immediately afterwards

[[h.3q5sasy]]
=== Moderating

The *Moderation* function allows you to moderate debates and ensure they are democratic and constructive. Making use of this function, administrators, collaborators and the moderator of a process can hide the contents/ contributions that have been reported, where the complaint is deemed appropriate, or delete the complaint.

Contents are generally deemed reportable where they are offensive, can be regarded as spam (advertising posts whether or not related to the discussion topic, links to malicious websites, trolling, abusive or unsolicited information), or have nothing to do with the subject under discussion.

To manage reported contents, click on *Moderations* from the process's submenu. A screen will appear with all the comments that have been reported pending moderation and the following information for each of them (<<moderations-fig>>):

* *Reportable*: where this concerns a *Proposal* or *Comment*.
* *Reported content URL*: link for seeing the content reported and the reasons for the complaint.
* *Reports*: why it has been reported. It could be: because: it has nothing to do with the discussion (“does_not_belong”), it is spam or it is an offensive comment).
* *Count*: Number of times it has been reported by different users
* *Actions*: by clicking on the items on the right you can *Unreport* or *Hide*.

[#moderations-fig]
._Modeations_.
image::image42.png[image]

Reported contents that have already been concealed can be seen by clicking *NOT HIDDEN* (in the upper right of the moderator box). A list of concealed reported contents will appear, with the following information for each of them (<<hidden-content-fig>>): REPORTABLE, REPORTED CONTENT URL, REPORTS, COUNT, HIDDEN AT date (date the content was concealed on), ACTIONS (in this case the action available is *Unreport*).

To return to visible reported contents, click on *NOT HIDDEN* on the upper right of the moderations.

=== Features/ Components

Participatory processes currently have the following components:

* *PAGE*: Static pages with multi-language support which optionally allow comments and iframes to be added.
* *MEETINGS*: meetings in person, in other words face-to-face events included in a process.
* *PROPOSALS*: written contributions posted by users on the platform, which can be voted on.
* *BUDGETS*: a specific module for deploying a participatory budget process. This allows a minimum percentage of  the total budget to be set for supporting submitted projects.

[[accountability]]
==== Accountability
The *Accountability* component allows people who visit the platform to view the level of execution (global, by categories and / or subcategories), of the results of a participatory process. That is to say, the proposals that have ended up being the result of the decision making in the Decidim, either directly (through the result of the application of a voting system) or mediated by meetings, assemblies, technical or political team, and its degree of execution.

The results can be converted into projects or decomposed into subprojects, which can be described in more detail and for which the execution status can be defined, ranging from 0% execution to 100%. The results, projects and states can be updated through a CVS and manually through the administration interface.

To configure the *Accountability* component, go to the *PROCESSES* submenu and click first on *Features/ Components* then click on *Add feature/ Component* in the upper right part of the window and select *Accountability*.

[[process-groups]]
=== Process groups

A group of processes proves useful for subdividing large participatory processes into subprocesses according to scope (territorial areas of organisation, such as districts and neighbourhoods, or sectoral scopes). An example are the Municipal Action Plans (PAMs) where Action Plans can be grouped by District.

To configure participatory process groups, click on *PROCESS GROUP* from the menu on the left of the *DASHBOARD*.
