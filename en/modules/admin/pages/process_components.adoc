= Components

Participatory processes currently have the following components:

* xref:admin:component_accountability.adoc[*Accountability*]: allows to keep track of the results execution of a process.
It allows administrators to also relate them to the proposals and meetings that originated them.
* xref:admin:component_blog.adoc[*Blog*]: allows administrators to publish posts with news regarding a process.
* xref:admin:component_budgets.adoc[*Budgets*]: allows participants to vote in projects with amounts predefined. Used for
participatory budgeting processes. Allows to define different kind of rules, for instance a minimum percentage of the total budget or a minimum amount of projects.
* xref:admin:component_debates.adoc[*Debates*]: allows participants to have debates. Debates can be time limited or not.
* xref:admin:component_elections.adoc[*Elections*]: to have end-to-end auditable elections in a process. Uses the same
external system as xref:admin:votings.adoc[Votings] space.
* xref:admin:component_meetings.adoc[*Meetings*]: gatherings in person or online through videoconferences platforms.
* xref:admin:component_pages.adoc[*Page*]: static pages with multi-language support.
* xref:admin:component_proposals.adoc[*Proposals*]: contributions posted by participants which can be given support.
* xref:admin:component_sortitions.adoc[*Sortitions*]: this allows different kind of proposals to be selected randomly.
For instance the proposals could be candidates who form part of a group (such as a committee).
* xref:admin:component_surveys.adoc[*Survey*]: for conducting surveys with different kinds of questions.

In the cases where your needs are not covered by one of the above components, you can create your own component through a xref:develop:modules.adoc[Module].
