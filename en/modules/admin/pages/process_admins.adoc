= Process Admins

You can give permissions to users with special rights in a participatory process,
so they can only have access to some of the administration pages in this process.
These roles are administrators, moderators, collaborators, or valuators.

* Process administrators: they can administer the process and change the process settings.
* Process collaborators: they can see the process and its components before it's published and view the process settings.
They can't change anything.
* Process moderators: they can see the reported contents of the process and hide or unhide them.
* Process valuators: they can evaluate proposals. Used by participatory budgeting processes.

To invite them, in the process's submenu, go to *Process admins*Â and click on *New process admin*.
