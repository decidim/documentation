= Hashtags

Hashtags are a way to categorize content globally on the platform and make it more easily searchable through these categorizations. It allows different related contents to be easily discoverable under the same topic. Similar functionality is often used in other social media platforms.

Hashtags can be set for different records within the platform, such as participatory spaces. They can also be generated for content created by the participants to allow easier discovery of the content. Some components may also allow setting suggested hashtags or specific hashtags for all records submitted by the participants.
