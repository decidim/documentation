= Supports

Through supports, participants can vote for a particular content, for instance, a proposal.

This is done through the button in the sidebar. Administrators can enable or disable them by step in a given participatory process, and they can also define permissions with authorizations.

== Supports v endorsements

Supports differ from :xref:features/endorsements.adoc[endorsements] in the following ways:
* Supports can be made private (hidden from public view) whereas endorsements are always public
* Supports are counted as a formal vote, whereas endorsements are considered a public show of support, similar to a 'like' as used on social networks
* Supports are available on non-voting areas of Dedicim such as blog posts
