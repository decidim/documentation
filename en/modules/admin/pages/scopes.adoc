= Scopes

Scopes are the set of territories or subjects that an Organization has. A scope may have child scopes.

For instance, in the case of the city of Barcelona the scopes are its districts, and the children of a district are its neighborhoods. They can also have types, so it can be configured, for example, by thematic and also territorial scopes.

Most of the components and spaces in Decidim allow you to configure Scopes in one way or another. There are mainly three ways of using Scopes:

To configure Scope on the Decidim platform, go to menu:Settings[Scopes] in the admin sidebar menu. A list will appear with the existing scopes if there are any:

If you need so, you need to first configure the Scope type.

== Features

The main features related with scopes are:
. Filtering
. User interests and Newsletters

=== Filtering

For filtering. Most of the spaces and components allows an administrator or a participant to associate them to a scope. This allows to filter by scopes when exploring them.

image:scopes_filter_processes.png[Processes scopes filtering]

Some examples:

* With Accountability module, so it's possible to filter Results
* Assemblies and Processes can have Scopes. It's used for filtering multiple assemblies in the main listing page (/assemblies or /processes).
* Filtering in the sidebar is possible in Budgets Projects, Initiatives and Proposals.

You can also configure a participatory space so the filtering will only concern one scope and its children scopes. For example, let's imagine your organization have 3 different scopes for 3 cities, each of them having children scopes for the cities neighbourhoods. 
On a participatory space which concerns only one of the cities, you will be able to select only this scope and its children so that users do not see the scopes of other cities in the filter options. 

=== User interests and Newsletters

A Participant can choose which Scopes she wants to follow in its account.

This is used by the xref:admin:newsletters.adoc[Newsletters], in the "Select recipients to deliver" step, "Filter for users having activated any selected scope in their account's My Interests settings." section.
