= Phases

A participatory process is a sequence of phases ordered in time. Depending on which phase of the process timeline you
are, then you can enable or disable some features.

Ideally, the Phases of a Participatory Process are always the same and are not changed, so participants can know what are
the rules and timeframe and can organize their lives to know when it'd be best for them to participate in this process.

As a guideline, the standard structure of a participatory process may be as follows:

. Presentation
. Diagnosis
. Proposal creation and debate
. Proposals prioritization
. Proposals evaluation
. Monitoring

Participants can find the link to different phases of a participatory process in the header of the participatory process,
in the link "Process phases". Here they can see the full description and explanation of the phases. The active phase
will be highlighted.
