= Pages

You can configure static Pages, which contains general information to the participants of the platform. 

As an example, some of these pages could refer to:

* What's this platform? Who's the organization? 
* How can I participate here?
* How can I create and verify my account?
* What are the terms of conditions and the legal information about this platform? 

These pages will be available to all the participants through the **Help** top menu section and also at the footer sections. You can define **Topics** to categorize all of these pages. 

As the platform enables the Participants to sign up (register) and save some of their personal data, it's important that there's an especial page, called **Terms and Conditions**. This is where you need to put your legal terms, for instance which entity has control of this data, how much time does this data will be saved, etc. This should be (ideally) written and (at least) reviewed by a lawyer.

== Special "Terms and Conditions" page

This is where you need to put your legal terms, for instance which entity has control of this data, how much time does this data will be saved, etc. This should be (ideally) written and (at least) reviewed by a lawyer. 

It's generated by default in a new installation. It can't be deleted, and it has a few special details related with its legal nature: 

. It's shown in the text area sign up form
. If there are meaningful changes, it has a field that can allow an admin  when it's necessary that the participants accept the "Terms and Conditions" again, in the next sign in.

If a participant rejects to accept the terms, then she has three options:

. To review this again later. It signs her out automatically.
. To download their personal data
. To delete her account
