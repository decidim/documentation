= Participants

Sometimes as an administrator you'll need to make certain tasks with participants, among them:

* To give permissions to other administrators so they can manage platform's content
* To verify user groups (organizations or collectives)
* To verify participants
* To recognize that a participant has a special status in the platform, with Officializations
* To authenticate that a person has the right to vote, with Authorizations
* To contact a participant

You can access this section on the main sidebar of the admin panel.
