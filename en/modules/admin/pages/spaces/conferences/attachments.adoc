= Attachments

Attachments allow an administrator to upload static files to a conference.

When a conference is launched, it is important to provide citizens with as much information as possible about them so
that they can participate with knowledge. That is why it is helpful to add files (Attachments) with the information that
is considered relevant.

Optionally, these documents can be grouped in *Folders*.

They can be found on the Conference "Media and links" section:

Read more about this in xref:admin:spaces/conferences/media_links.adoc[Media links].
