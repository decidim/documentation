You can control how it's the Homepage of your organization. To do so you have the Settings -> Homepage section through the Administration panel:

---

== How this works 

This means that every section in the Homepage is called **content block**.

For instance, this is the *How to participate* content block: 

image::homepage_how_to_participate.png[How to participate example]

For managing these contents you need to Drag and Drop the contents between the two columns, on the left are the Active and in the Right are the Inactive content blocks. 

As an example, here you can see how your page will look with only the *Hero image* content block: 

// TODO: add screenshot

At the admin this is handled with: 

// TODO: add screenshot

In your installation you could have other content blocks, as this depends on which modules you have active. Please contact your system administrator if you see something different here, like a missing content block.

== Content blocks

These are the different content blocks enabled with the official Decidim modules:

=== Hero image
