= Newsletters

Newsletters are emails sent to the organization's participants with the news. They are
sent to participants that have checked the "Receive an occasional newsletter
with relevant information" when the participant signed up or after in their account.

Some examples of when you can and should sent a newsletter are:

* When a new process could be interesting for all the citizens in a city,
for instance a Participatory Budgeting process.
* When there are the results published for a given process.
* When an assembly has a important point for discussion.
* When there's a new voting planned.
* When there's a new conference published

In the secondary sidebar or in the top of the list you have the button for "New
newsletter".

== 4. Select recipients to deliver

If you want to only communicate about a given space, one useful way of doing this
is through the "Select recipients to deliver". Here you can choose between:

* Sending the newsletter to all confirmed users
* Sending the newsletter to all confirmed users that have participated in any of
the selected participatory spaces in the list
* Sending the newsletter to all confirmed users that have followed any of
the selected participatory spaces in the list
* Sending the newsletter to all the participants that have selected an scope in
their "My interests" settings in their account.

It's important to note that even if a participant has confirmed its account and
is following the space, the system will not send her a newsletter email if she
haven't activated the "I want to receive newsletters".

If you select the "Sent do participants" or "Send to followers" of a given space,
then you can choose which spaces are relevant:

== 5. Deliver the newsletter

Finally if you click in the "Deliver newsletter" button, the newsletter will be
sent to all the selected recipients.

[NOTE]
====
Once a newsletter was sent it can't be undone nor edited. If you have multiple
languages active, be careful with reviewing all the languages well before sending.
