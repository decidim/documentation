:_summary: Decidim [https://decidim.org] is a digital infrastructure for participatory democracy written on free software (Ruby on Rails), which enables the creation of citizen participation portals. Users of the platform (participants) interact through participatory mechanisms known as components which provide specific functions for the various participatory spaces. In other words, participatory spaces such as Initiatives, Assemblies, Processes and Consultations have components at their disposal which work together as participatory mechanisms. The more notable components include in-person meetings, surveys, proposals, votes, results monitoring and comments. For example, the various stages of a specific participatory process, such as the preparation of participatory budgets, can incorporate various components to: convene and capture the results of in-person meetings with citizens, conduct a survey, make proposals and, during the final stages of the process, hold a vote to decide on the projects with a budget expenditure system (always after a period for commentary and debate), conduct an assessment survey and, finally, monitor the implementation of the projects selected.
